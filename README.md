# MechE-to-SWE
A place to store and curate important topics on my journey towards becoming a better SWE. Topics include Ordered and Unordered Data Structures, Algorithms, and a collection of all of my LeetCode submissions.

### [LeetCode ](https://leetcode.com/)
Submissions to various problems written exclusively in C++. I often include a brute force solution and then optimize as time permits 


### [Ordered Data Structres](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-2)
Part 2 of 3 in Coursera's Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization. This folder contains solutions to all of the homeworks and challenge problems throughout the course. Topics include Linked Lists, Tree Structures, Heaps, etc.

### [Unordered Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-3)
Part 3 of 3 in Coursera's Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization. This folder contains solutions for the homeworks and challenge problems. Topcis covered include Hash Tables, Disjoint Sets, Graph Structures, and some Search algorithms

### [Princeton Algorithms-I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
Some homeworks are submitted from the Coursera course. Good resources can be found at the actual [course website](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). I've used this course mostly to get familiar with the concepts of data structures and some algorithms.
